        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>You must report back to your director that you've ended the leave. There are some instance where you need to return back before your stated date. The supervisor needs to know
          that you've completed. If you failed to report back, the system will continue with salary deductions until you report so that your supervisor close your leave. You can utilise your payslip report here
          to get your deductions and also you can use your leave requests to check on the status of your leave.
